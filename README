THIS REPOSITORY WILL BE USED TO TRACK MY STUDY PROGRESS WHEN STUDYING FOR CCNP ENAUTO

I AM NOT THE BEST AT PYTHON BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY PROGRESS AND MY EFFORTS. 

I'VE USED NICK RUSSO'S VIDEOS AS A REFERENCE BUT I WILL NOT USE HIS CODE DIRECTLY TO DO TESTING

I WILL INSTEAD CREATE ALL MY OWN CODE FROM SCRATCH AND USE THE POWER OF GOOGLE AND CHATGPT TO LEARN
