NETCONF PRACTICE
GOALS
- get config 
- get specific interface config
- Create Loopback interface
- delete loopback interface
- edit loopback interface


NOTES:
    - if you want to complete a NC operation to remove configuration, you need to specify a NC name space so that it knows
      ex: "@xmlns:nc": "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0",
    - to make any changes to the configuration you need to have the config tag in the payload sent to the device
      ex: <config></config>
