    - had a hard time figuring out the proper way to format my payload
    - initially i thought I had to send it as a dict but then i tried as a list
    - it ended up having to be a regular dict I think what I did wrong was that I sent it as a python dictionary instead of a json payload
    - also I should have sent it as a PUT request instead of POST since I am just editting a list element called "interface" and not creating a new list
